## Node Beginner

Recently came across both Node Beginner and Node Craftsman Book by Manuel Kiessling which were recommended readings to getting my bearings with NodeJS and Javascript in general as it pertains to web development. Many argue that the two books are the 1:1 to Michael Hartl's Rails tutorial book (which I highly recommend, I've learned so much going through it twice before I gained confidence to create my own applications).

The focus of Node Beginner is on understanding how Node works on the fundamental level less how to create web apps using Node and frameworks. I believe that it's very important to understand how these technologies work as it makes me a more informed and well rounded developer.
